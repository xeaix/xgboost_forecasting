## XGBoost Forecasting

### Description:

This project demonstrates the application of XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for predicting subscriber churn in a telecommunications (telco) dataset. By employing supervised learning techniques, the model forecasts whether a subscriber is likely to churn based on historical data and relevant features.

### Objective:

The primary objective is to showcase the effectiveness of XGBoost in predicting telco subscriber churn. The model is trained on a dataset containing historical information about subscribers, enabling it to make accurate forecasts and assist telco providers in proactively managing customer retention.

### Key Features:

- Supervised Learning: The project utilizes a supervised learning approach, leveraging labeled historical data to train the XGBoost model to predict future subscriber behavior.
- XGBoost Algorithm: XGBoost is chosen for its ability to handle complex relationships in data, providing high accuracy and robust performance in classification tasks.
- Forecasting Churn: The model's focus is on forecasting subscriber churn, enabling telco providers to take preemptive actions to retain customers.
- Classification Report: The project includes a comprehensive classification report, offering insights into the model's performance, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

### How to Use:

1. Dataset: Ensure that the telco dataset is formatted correctly, with features and corresponding labels indicating subscriber churn.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data as needed, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
3. Training the XGBoost Model: Use the provided code to train the XGBoost model on the preprocessed dataset. Tweak hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using the classification report to understand its precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy.

### Contributions and Feedback:

Contributions, bug reports, and feedback are highly encouraged. Whether you identify an issue or have suggestions for enhancing the functionality and performance of the telco subscriber forecasting model, feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
